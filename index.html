								<h2>About Me</h2>
								<p  style="align-content: center;"> As a Full Stack Software Engineer, I thrive on turning complex problems into elegant solutions. <br />
								My journey in software development has been driven by a passion for creating seamless user experiences while building robust, scalable systems from the ground up. <br />
							    <br /> 
									In my role as a full stack developer, I've had the opportunity to work across the entire tech stack, from crafting responsive front-end interfaces to architecting efficient back-end systems.
									I believe in writing clean, maintainable code that not only works well today but can adapt to tomorrow's challenges. <br />
									<br />
									My technical toolkit includes modern JavaScipt frameworks such as Angular and React, cloud services, and database systems, allowing me to deliver end-to-end solutions that make a real impact.
									Whether it's optimizing database queries, implementing security best practices, or ensuring pixel-perfect responsive designs, I enjoy diving deep into every aspect of the development process.
								<br />
								<br />
									What excites me most about software engineering is the constant opportunity to learn and grow. Technology evolves rapidly, and I'm committed to staying at the forefront of industry best practices and emerging technologies.
									When I'm not coding, you can find me contributing to open source projects, playing sports, or exploring new technologies that can enhance my development workflow. 
								<br />
								<br /> 
									I'm always open to discussing new projects, technical challenges, or opportunities to collaborate. Feel free to reach out -- I'd love to connect and explore how we can work together to bring your ideas to life.
